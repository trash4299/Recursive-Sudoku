# Recursive-Sudoku

I am making a recursive Sudoku solver to compare against my non-recursive solver. I am making the recursion happen with a void method which is intersting and tough. The solver method has to go back and forth between cells which means transversing the array in the x and y directions and have control signals inside itself to tell it which way to go. Right now, whenever I put a puzzle through it, it takes forever and I always get too impatient and stop it. So I am not sure whether it is because it is trying to find one of the 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 possible solutions or whether my code is broken and it is stuck in a loop somewhere.
