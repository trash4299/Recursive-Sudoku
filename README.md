# Recursive-Sudoku

I am making a recursive Sudoku solver to compare against my non-recursive solver. I am making the recursion happen with a void method which is intersting and tough. The solver method has to go back and forth between cells which means transversing the array in the x and y directions and have control signals inside itself to tell it which way to go. Right now, it runs through but then halfway it starts giving doing wrong things.
